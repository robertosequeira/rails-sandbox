# rails-sandbox

Purpose of this repo is to track changes added while doing some experiments related to rails features and tools regularly used at the Rails ecosystem.

By now the site is hosted at a $5/mo DigitalOcean VPS and can be accessed at [rails.roberto-sequeira.com](http://rails.roberto-sequeira.com)

## Server configuration

For server configuration I followed some DigitalOcean's tutorials which seems to be a great documentation source.
